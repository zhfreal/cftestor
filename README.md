# cftestor:  Find and verify the best IPs for Cloudflare CDN

In some regions, we can't get the best access from Cloudflare CDN due to the ISP disturbed. So, this util could find better IPs for you to access Cloudflare CDN with lower legacy and greater speed.

## How does it work?
1. Our goal is find better IPs to access Cloudflare CDN with lower legacy and greater speed. So we will perform Delay Test (DT) and Download Test (DLT) sequentially for an IP as assessment moves.
2. We do DT by SSL/TLS shakhand or HTTPS get with the target IP. If it secceed to perform SSL/TLS or HTTPS get, we take the times escapted as delay. We will try several times to perfrom DT for a single IP and count the success tries. If it's success rate ( equal to <count of success>/<tries> ) is not less than what we expected, and the average delay ( <sum of every delay>/<count of success> ) is not bigger than we expected, it pass the DT.
3. If an IP passed DT, then we perform DLT with it. We download some test data with it, caculate the average download speed. If the average speed is not less than we expected, it's a successful DLT. We can perform several DLT sequentially to evaluate download speed accurately.
4. If an IP passsed DLT, it's what we need exactly.

    Usage: cftestor [options]
    options:
        -s, --ip            string  Specific IP or CIDR for test. E.g.: "-s 1.0.0.1", "-s 1.0.0.1/32",
                                    "-s 1.0.0.1/24".
        -i, --in            string  Specific file for test, which contains multiple lines. Each line
                                    represent one IP or CIDR.
        -m, --dt-thread     int     Number of concurrent threads for Delay Test(DT). How many IPs can
                                    be perform DT at the same time. Default 20 threads.
        -t, --dt-timeout    int     Timeout for single DT, unit ms, default 1000ms. A single SSL/TLS
                                    or HTTPS request and response should be finished before timeout.
                                    It should not be less than "-k|--delay-limit", It should be
                                    longger when we perform https connections test by "-dt-via-https"
                                    than when we perform SSL/TLS test by default.
        -c, --dt-count      int     Tries of DT for a IP, default 4.
        -p, --port          int     Port to test, default 443. It's valid when "--only-dt" and "--dt-via-https".
            --hostname      string  Hostname for DT test. It's valid when "--dt-only" is no and "--dt-via-https"
                                    is not provoided.
            --dt-via-https          DT via https other than SSL/TLS shakehand. It's disabled by default,
                                    we do DT via SSL/TLS.
        -n, --dlt-thread    int     Number of concurrent Threads for Download Test(DLT), default 1.
                                    How many IPs can be perform DLT at the same time.
        -d, --dlt-period    int     The total times escaped for single DLT, default 10s.
        -b, --dlt-count     int     Tries of DLT for a IP, default 1.
        -u, --url           string  Customize test URL for DLT.
        -I  --interval      int     Interval between two tests, unit ms, default 500ms.
        -k, --delay-limit   int     Delay filter for DT, unit ms, default 600ms. If A ip's average delay
                                    bigger than this value after DT, it is not qualified and won't do
                                    DLT if DLT required.
        -S, --dtpr-limit    float   The DT pass rate filter, default 100%. It means do 4 times DTs by
                                    default for a IP, it's passed just when no single DT failed.
        -l, --speed         float   Download speed filter, Unit KB/s, default 6000KB/s. After DLT, it's
                                    qualified when its speed is not lower than this value.
        -r, --result        int     The total IPs qualified limitation, default 10. The Process will stop
                                    after it got equal or more than this indicated. It would be invalid if
                                    "--test-all" was set.
            --dt-only               Do DT only, we do DT & DLT at the same time by default.
            --dlt-only              Do DLT only, we do DT & DLT at the same time by default.
        -4, --ipv4                  Just test IPv4. When we don't specify IPs to test by "-s" or "-i",
                                    then it will do IPv4 test from build-in IPs from CloudFlare by default.
        -6, --ipv6                  Just test IPv6. When we don't specify IPs to test by "-s" or "-i",
                                    then it will do IPv6 test from build-in IPs from CloudFlare by using
                                    this flag.
        -a  --test-all              Test all IPs until no more IP left. It's disabled by default.
        -w, --store-to-file         Write result to csv file, disabled by default. If it is provoided and
                                    "-o|--result-file" is not provoided, the result file will be named
                                    as "Result_<YYYYMMDDHHMISS>-<HOSTNAME>.csv" and be stored in current DIR.
        -o, --result-file   string  File name of result. If it don't provoided and "-w|--store-to-file"
                                    is provoided, the result file will be named as
                                    "Result_<YYYYMMDDHHMISS>-<HOSTNAME>.csv" and be stroed in current DIR.
        -e, --store-to-db           Write result to sqlite3 db file, disabled by default. If it's provoided
                                    and "-f|--db-file" is not provoided, it will be named "ip.db" and
                                    store in current directory.
        -f, --db-file       string  Sqlite3 db file name. If it's not provoided and "-e|--store-to-db" is
                                    provoided, it will be named "ip.db" and store in current directory.
        -g, --label         string  Lable for a part of the result file's name and sqlite3 record. It's
                                    hostname from "--hostname" or "-u|--url" by default.
            --no-tcell      bool    Don't use tcell to display the running procedure, disabled by default.
        -V, --debug                 Print debug message.
